Platformer thing with Unity

##Important notes
 - Level data/code is source controlled here on github
 - All binary assets are stored on a shared Google Drive directory
 - Project settings/editor settings do not need to be synced to this repo at this time(?), use your judgment here.

##Setup Instructions
1. Clone repo
 - Make sure your Unity editor is set to serialise level data etc.. Verify [Step 1-4](http://tylrmac.com/configuring-a-unity3d-project-for-github/) of this guide
2. Download [Google Drive](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive) Desktop Application
 - Get edit/share permissions to asset directory on GDrive
 - Sync asset directory to local GDrive folder
3. Symbolic link the GDrive folders to their corresponding locations in the repo
 - Use [Link](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html) Shell Extension to save time
